How to contribute to opmuse.

Code style
----------

We use `PEP8`_ but we exclude E251 (no whitespace around keyword / parameter
equals) and we have a max line length of 120 chars but we try to keep the line
length at around 80 chars.

Keep in mind that readability is more important than convention and convention
is more important than performance.
